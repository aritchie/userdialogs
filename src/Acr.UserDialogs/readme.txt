ACR UserDialogs

# Support Platforms

* iOS 8+
* Android - Set your target to Android 8.1+
* Universal Windows Platform (Win10/UWP)
* NET Standard 2.0

## Setup

To use, simply reference the nuget package in each of your platform projects.

#### iOS and Windows

    Nothing is necessary any longer as of v4.x.  There is an Init function for iOS but it is OPTIONAL and only required if you want/need to control
    the top level viewcontroller for things like iOS extensions.  Progress prompts will not use this factory function though!

#### Android Initialization (In your main activity OnCreate function)

    UserDialogs.Init(this);
    OR UserDialogs.Init(() => provide your own top level activity provider)
    OR MvvmCross - UserDialogs.Init(() => Mvx.IoCProvider.Resolve<IMvxAndroidCurrentTopActivity>().Activity)
    OR Xamarin.Forms - UserDialogs.Init(() => this);
